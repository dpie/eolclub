== iCalendar event entry format

The SEQUENCE and LAST-MODIFIED properties are used when an event is modified
after publication.  When an event is first published, SEQUENCE should have a
value of 0 and LAST-MODIFIED is optional.  When revising an event, SEQUENCE
should be incremented, and LAST-MODIFIED should be updated to reflect the
timestamp of the revision.

iCalendar is defined in [RFC 5545](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545).
